# AI-Skill-Gap-Naviator
An AI-powered employability guidance platform🚀

From confusion to clarity — powered by AI

An AI-powered employability guidance platform designed to help students from Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges identify job-relevant skill gaps and receive a personalized learning roadmap based on their resume, GitHub profile, and target job role.

📌 Problem Statement

Students from Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges often complete technical degrees but remain unemployable due to:

Lack of clarity on role-specific skills

Generic, one-size-fits-all courses

Weak resumes and irrelevant GitHub projects

No feedback loop on why they get rejected

This leads to wasted effort, poor portfolios, and repeated job rejections.
